# Pairamizer
## Random Pair Generator

### Implemented Features

- This app reads a `cadet-list.txt` file containing a list where each item is seperated by a new line.
  - The file must be in the same directory as app
- The app shuffles the list, randomly generating and printing the new pairs into a `pairs-list.txt` file.
  - The app will check pairs included in `pairs-list.txt` as to generate different pairs each time the program is ran
  - If the combinations have been exhausted, the app prints a warning in the console.
- The app handles both odd and even cadet-list size
